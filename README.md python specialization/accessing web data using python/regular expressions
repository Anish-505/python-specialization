import re
handle = open('/content/regular expression.txt')
numlist = []
for line in handle:
    line =line.rstrip()
    # Find all numbers in the line, including those with decimal points
    num = re.findall(r'[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*', line)
    for n in num:
        numlist.append(float(n))
print("Sum:", sum(numlist))
